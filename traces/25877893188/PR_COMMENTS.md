## Summary

This PR adds a new term for **fibrochondrocyte progenitor cell (FCP)** in response to issue #3458.

## Changes Made

### New Term: CL_9900000 - fibrochondrocyte progenitor cell

**Term Details:**
- **ID:** CL_9900000 (from the temporary ID range as specified in cl-idranges.owl)
- **Label:** fibrochondrocyte progenitor cell
- **Synonym:** FCP (abbreviation, related synonym with PMID:31871141 reference)
- **Definition:** A mesenchymal progenitor cell located in fibrocartilaginous tissues, along the fibrochondrocytic differentiation pathway that co-expresses both fibrochondrocyte markers (COL1A1, COL3A1) and mesenchymal stem cell markers (MCAM/CD146, MYLK) in humans. FCP demonstrates colony-forming capacity and multi-lineage differentiation potential toward osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. This cell serves as a progenitor for mature fibrochondrocytes and other meniscal cell types, with differentiation regulated by TGF-β signaling, focal adhesion, and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction pathways.

**Logical Relationships:**
- SubClassOf: mesenchymal cell (CL_0008019)
- SubClassOf: progenitor cell (CL_0011026)
- SubClassOf: part_of some fibrocartilage (UBERON_0001995)
- SubClassOf: expresses some collagen alpha-1(I) chain (PR_000003264 / COL1A1)
- SubClassOf: expresses some collagen alpha-1(III) chain (PR_000003328 / COL3A1)

## Implementation Decisions

### Protein Markers
The issue requested four protein markers to be expressed:
1. ✅ COL1A1 (collagen alpha-1(I) chain) - Added as PR_000003264
2. ✅ COL3A1 (collagen alpha-1(III) chain) - Added as PR_000003328  
3. ⚠️ MCAM/CD146 (cell surface glycoprotein MUC18) - Mentioned in definition text only
4. ⚠️ MYLK (myosin light chain kinase, smooth muscle) - Mentioned in definition text only

I successfully added formal logical axioms for COL1A1 and COL3A1 using their PRO identifiers which are already used in the ontology for related cell types (fibrochondrocyte CL_4072104 and proliferative fibrochondrocyte CL_0020018).

For MCAM/CD146 and MYLK, I was unable to definitively identify the correct PRO identifiers used in this ontology. These markers are mentioned in the textual definition, which accurately reflects the biology described in the referenced publications. Future enhancements could add formal logical axioms for these markers once the appropriate PRO identifiers are confirmed.

### Parent Terms
Following the issue request, I assigned two parent classes:
- **mesenchymal cell (CL_0008019)** - Appropriate as FCP is described as a mesenchymal progenitor
- **progenitor cell (CL_0011026)** - Appropriate as FCP demonstrates progenitor characteristics including colony-forming capacity and multi-lineage differentiation potential

### Anatomical Location
- **part_of fibrocartilage (UBERON_0001995)** - Matches the issue request and the biological description of FCP being located in fibrocartilaginous tissues like the meniscus

## Validation

- ✅ Term ID follows OBO guidelines (CL_9900000 from temporary ID range)
- ✅ Definition includes inline references to PMIDs
- ✅ Synonym includes appropriate reference
- ✅ Parent terms are consistent with biology
- ✅ Anatomical location is specified
- ✅ Contributor ORCID added as requested
- ✅ Followed existing term patterns (see CL_0020018 proliferative fibrochondrocyte for similar structure)
- ✅ File syntax follows OWL functional syntax format (one axiom per line)
- ✅ All referenced classes (parent terms, proteins, anatomical structures) are already declared in the ontology

## Background Research

During implementation, I reviewed:
1. **PMID:31871141** - Referenced paper describing FCP characteristics and markers
2. **PMID:36338137** - Additional reference for FCP biology
3. **Existing related terms:**
   - CL_4072104 (fibrochondrocyte) - The differentiated cell type
   - CL_0020018 (proliferative fibrochondrocyte) - Related cell type that already mentions FCP in its definition
4. **Protein Ontology references** - To identify correct PRO identifiers for expressed proteins

The definition in CL_0020018 (proliferative fibrochondrocyte) explicitly mentions "fibrochondrocyte progenitors (FCP)" and describes them as being "positioned at the root of developmental trajectories," which aligns with and supports the creation of this new FCP term.

## Next Steps

As mentioned in the original issue, the requester plans to add a 'develops from' relationship to the fibrochondrocyte term (CL_4072104) to link it to this new progenitor cell. This would complete the lineage relationship:

```
fibrochondrocyte (CL_4072104) develops_from some fibrochondrocyte progenitor cell (CL_9900000)
```

This relationship should be added in a future update to establish the complete developmental hierarchy.
